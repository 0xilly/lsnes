3 Building

• Copy bsnes sources (the bsnes subdirectory) to subdirectory 
  'bsnes' (for bsnes core).

• Copy gambatte sources to subdirectory 'gambatte' (for gambatte 
  core).

• Patch the bsnes sources with included patches (directory 
  'bsnes-patches/<version>', bsnes core)

• Patch the gambatte sources with included patches (directory 
  'gambatte-patches/<version>', gambatte core)

• Edit options.build (or copy of that file)

• Run make (passing 'OPTIONS=<filename>' if using something else 
  than options.build).

4 Command line options

4.1 Wxwidgets options

4.1.1 --rom=<file>

Load <file> as ROM.

4.1.2 --load=<file> (lsnes/wxwidgets)

Load <file> as movie or savestate file on startup.

4.1.3 --settings

Instead of starting the emulator, only display the settings.

4.2 dump options (lsnes-dumpavi only)

4.2.1 --rom=<file>

dumpers.

4.2.4 --firmware-path=<path>

Set path to look for firmware.

4.2.5 --mode=<mode>

Set the mode to use (required for dumpers with multiple modes, 
forbidden otherwise). Use 'list' for known modes.

4.2.6 --prefix=<prefix>

Set dump prefix. Default is “avidump”.

4.2.7 --option=<name>=<value>

Set option <name> to value <value>.

4.2.8 --length=<length>

initialization files).

4.2.10 --load-library=<library>

Load the specified shared object / dynamic library / dynamic link 
library.

4.3 lsnes settings directory

The lsnes settings directory is (in order of decreasing 
perference):

• Windows: %APPDATA%\lsnes (if %APPDATA% exists)

• Unix: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lsnes (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME exists)

• Unix: $HOME/.config/lsnes (if $HOME exists)

• All: . (fallback default).

If leading directories do not exist, attempt to create them is 
made.

5 Internal commands

• Commands beginning with '*' invoke the corresponding command 
  without alias expansion.

• If command starts with '+' (after possible '*'), the command is 
  executed as-is when button is pressed, and when button is 
  released, it is executed with '+' replaced by '-'.

• Commands without '+' execute only on negative edge (release).

5.1 run-script <script>

Run <script> as if commands were entered on the command line.

5.2 Memory manipulation

<address> may be decimal or hexadecimal (prefixed with '0x'). 
<value> can be hexadecimal (prefixed with '0x'), unsigned or 
signed (prefixed with '-') decimal.

The available element <sizes> are:

• byte: 1 byte

• word: 2 bytes

• dword: 4 bytes

• qword: 8 bytes

When reading RAM and ROM, multi-byte reads/writes are big-endian. 
When dealing with DSP memory, multi-byte reads/writes are 
native-endian (do not use operand sizes exceeding DSP bitness, 
except dword is OK for 24-bit memory).

5.2.1 read-<size> <address>

Read the value of byte in <address>.

5.2.2 read-s<size> <address>

Read the value of signed byte in <address>.

5.2.3 write-<size> <address> <value>

Write <value> to byte in address <address>.

of a hook. Example code:

on_paint = loopwrapper(function(wait)

  while true do

    gui.text(0, 0, “Test!”);

    wait();

  end

end);

has been run).

7.13.6 Callback: on_rewind()

Called when rewind movie to beginning has completed.

7.13.7 Callback: on_pre_load(string name)

Called just before savestate/movie load occurs (note: loads are 
always delayed, so this occurs even when load was initiated by 
lua).

Called when SNES is reset.

7.13.16 Callback: on_readwrite()

Called when moving into readwrite mode as result of “set-rwmode”

recursive entry protection).

7.13.17 Callback: on_snoop(number port, number controller, number 
  index, number value)

Called each time bsnes asks for input. The value is the final 
value to be sent to bsnes core (readonly mode, autohold and 
autofire have been taken into account). Might be useful when 
translating movies to format suitable for console verification. 
Note: There is no way to modify the value to be sent.

7.13.18 Callback: on_keyhook(string keyname, table state)

Called when requested by set_idle_timeout(), the timeout has 
expired and emulator is waiting.

7.13.20 Callback: on_timer()

Called when requested by set_idle_timeout() and the timeout has 
expired (regardless if emulator is waiting).

Called just before unsafe rewind is about to occur.

7.13.23 Callback: on_post_rewind() 

Called just after unsafe rewind has occured.

8 Movie editor

• The editor edits in-memory movie.

• Because past can't be edited and readwrite mode doesn't allow 
  future, editing only works in read only mode.

• Keyboard triggers the normal hotkeys and bindings.

8.1 Left button actions

• Clicking on cell in future (indicated by lack of redish 
  background) toggles it (if it is a button) or prompts for a 
  value (if it is an axis)

• Dragging vertically toggles sequence of buttons or changes a 
  sequence of axis values.

8.2 Right button actions

The right mouse button pops up a context-sensitive menu:

• Toggle <something>: Toggle this button

• Change <something>: Change this axis value

• Insert frame after: Insert a frame after this frame

• Append frame: Append a frame to movie

• Append frames: Append specified number of frames to movie

• Delete frame: Delete this frame

• Delete subframe: Delete this subframe

• Truncate movie: Delete this subframe and everything after it.

• Scroll to frame: Prompt for a frame and scroll the display to 
  that frame.

• Scroll to current frame: Scroll the display to current position

• Run to frame: Prompts for frame and runs the emulation to that 
  frame.

• Change number of lines visible: Change the height of the movie 
  display (1 to 255).

• Lock scroll to playback: While playing back or rewinding 
  movies, the display will follow if enabled.

9 Memory watch expression syntax

Memory watch expressions are in RPN (Reverse Polish Notation). At 
the end of expression, the top entry on stack is taken as the 
final result.

Notations:

• Evaluation order is strictly left to right.

• a is the entry on top of stack

• b is the entry immediately below top of stack

• ; separates values to be pushed (no intermediate pop).

• After end of element, all used stack slots are popped and all 
  results are pushed.

• When pushing multiple values, the pushes occur in order shown.

The following operators are available:

• + : a + b

• - : a - b

• * : a * b

• / : a / b

• % : a % b

• a : atan(a)

• b : read_signed_byte(a)

• c : cos(a)

• d : read_signed_dword(a)

• i : quotent(a / b)

• p :\pi


• q : read_signed_qword(a)

• r : sqrt(a)

• s : sin(a)

• t : tan(a)

• u : a; a

• w : read_signed_word(a)

• A : atan2(a, b)

• B : read_unsigned_byte(a)

• C<number>z : Push number <number> to stack.

• D : read_unsigned_dword(a)

• C0x<number>z : Push number <number> (hexadecimal) to stack.

• H<digit> : Set hexadecimal mode with specified number of digits 
  (use A-G for 10-16 digits).

• Q : read_unsigned_qword(a)

• R<digit> : round a to <digit> digits.

• W : read_unsigned_word(a)

9.1 Example:

C0x007e0878zWC0x007e002czW-

1. Push value 0x7e0878 on top of stack (C0x007e0878z).

2. Pop the value on top of stack (0x7e0878), read word value at 
  that address and push the result,call it x1 (W).

3. Push value 0x7e002c on top of stack (C0x007e002cz).

4. Pop the value on top of stack (0x7e002c), read word value at 
  that address and push the result,call it x2 (W).

5. Pop the two top numbers on stack, x1 and x2, substract x1 from 
  x2 and push x2 - x1 (-).

6. Since the expression ends, the final memory watch result is 
  the top one on stack, which is x2 - x1.

11.17 Member: savestate

The raw binary savestate itself. Savestate detection uses this 
file, only present in savestates.

11.18 Member: screenshot

Screenshot of current frame. Only present in savestates. First 2 
bytes are big-endian width of image, rest are 24-bit RGB image 
data. Height of image is inferred from the width and size of 
data.

11.19 Member: sram.<name>

Raw binary SRAM of kind <name> at time of savestate. Only present 
in savestates.

11.20 Member: input

The actual input track, one line per subframe (blank lines are 
skipped).

• If the first byte of each line is '.', ' ', <tab> or '|', then 
  the line is part of same frame as previous, otherwise it starts 
  a new frame.

• First subframe must start a new frame.

Length of movie in frames is number of lines in input file that 
start a new frame.

11.21 Member: subtitles

Subtitle track. Optional.

• Each line is in form <firstframe> <numframes> <text>.

• Linefeed is encoded as \n, backslash is encoded as \\.

11.22 Member: rerecords

Contains textual base-10 rerecord count (as one line; emulator 
just writes this, it doesn't read it) + 1.

11.23 Member: rrdata

This member stores set of load IDs. There is one load ID per 
rerecord (plus one corresponding to start of project).

• This member constists of concatenation of records

• Each record is 2-36 bytes long and can represent 1-16,843,009 
  consequtive IDs.

• IDs are interpretted as 256-bit big-endian integers with 
  warparound.

• Initial predicted ID is all zeroes.

Format of each record is:

• 1 byte: Opcode byte. Bits 0-4 are prefix length (prefixlen), 
  bits 5-6 are count length (countlen). Bit 7 is unused.

• 32-prefixlen bytes of ID.

• countlen bytes of big-endian count (count).

Records are processed as follows:

• To form the first ID encoded by record, take the first 
  prefixlen bytes predicted ID and append the read ID value to 
  it. The result is the first ID encoded.

• If countlen is 0, record encodes 1 ID.

• If countlen is 1, record encodes 2+count IDs.

• If countlen is 2, record encodes 258+count IDs.

• If countlen is 3, record encodes 65794+count IDs.

• The new predicted ID is the next ID after last one encoded by 
  the record.

The number of rerecords + 1 is equal to the sum of number of IDs 
encoded by all records.

11.24 Member: starttime.second

Movie starting time, second part. Epoch is Unix epoch. Default is 
1,000,000,000.

present in savestates.

11.27 Member: savetime.subsecond

Movie saving time, subsecond part. Default is 
starttime.subsecond. Only present in savestates.

12 lsvs file format (commentary tracks)

12.1 Clusters

• Each cluster is 8kB (8192 bytes) in size.

• Cluster n starts at offset 8192*n in file.

• The following clusters are system special:

  – Cluster 0 and all clusters with number multiple of 2048 
    (cluster tables)

  – Cluster 1 (superblock)

12.2 Cluster tables

• The cluster table describing cluster n is stored in cluster n & 
  ~0x7FF (zero last 11 bits of n).

• This cluster table consists of 2048 4-byte big-endian integers.

• Each entry describes a cluster in 16MB supercluster, in order.

• The valid values for entries are:

  – 0x00000000: Free cluster

  – 0x00000001: Last cluster in chain.

  – 0xFFFFFFFF: System cluster (cluster tables and superblock)

  – (anything else): Number of next cluster in chain. Must not be 
    multiple of 2048.

• Due to limitations of the format, there can be at most 2097052 
  superclusters, giving maximum file size of 16TB.

12.3 Stream table

• The stream table chain always starts in cluster 2.

• Otherwise, it follows normal chaining.

• The stream table consists of 16-byte entries:

  – The first 8 bytes of entry give big-endian beginning position 
    of stream in units of 1/48000 s.

  – The next 4 bytes of entry give big-endian beginning cluster 
    for control data. 0 here marks the entry as not present.

  – The last 4 bytes of entry give big-endian beginning cluster 
    for codec data.

• Stream table clusters are normal clusters, following normal 
  chaining.

• The stream begnning position is not guarenteed unique. There 
  can be multiple streams with the same starting position in the 
  file.

12.4 Stream control data

• The stream control data consists of entries 4 bytes each:

  – The first 2 bytes of entry gives big-endian length of packet

  – The next byte of entry gives audio length of packet in units 
    of 1/400 s.

  – The last byte is control byte.

    ∗ 0 means this entry is not present and the control data 
      ends.

    ∗ 1 is valid control entry.

• The stream control data can also end by running into end of the 
  readable chain.

  – This happens if there happens to be exact multiple of 2048 
    packets in stream and number of packets is nonzero.

• These clusters follow normal chaining.

12.5 Stream codec data

• Stream codec data consists of raw Opus data packets packed back 
  to back with nothing in between.

• Warning: Due to internal limitations, this data must reside in 
  the first 65536 superclusters (that is, the first 1TB of the 
  file).

12.6 Superblock

• The superblock is stored in cluster 1. 

• The first 11 bytes are “sefs-magic”<NUL>.

• The rest are unused.

• This cluster 1 is marked as system special.

13 Known ROM extensions

• SNES cartridge ROMs: sfc, smc, swc, fig, ufo, sf2, gd3, gd7, 
  dx2, mgd, mgh.

• DMG cartridge ROMs: dmg, gb.

• GBC cartridge ROMs: cgb, gbc.

14 Gamepack files

• The first line must be: “[GAMEPACK FILE]”.

• There is one needed line: “type <systype>”. This sets system 
  type to <systype>. The following system types are valid:

  – snes (SNES)

  – bsx (BS-X non-slotted)

  – bsxslotted (BS-X slotted)

  – sufamiturbo (Sufami Turbo)

  – sgb (Super Game Boy)

  – dmg (Game Boy)

  – gbc (Game Boy Color)

  – gbc_gba (Game Boy Color with GBA initial register values)

• Optionally a region can be specified: “region <region>”. The 
  following values are valid:

  – autodetect (Autodetect region: snes and sgb only)

  – ntsc (NTSC: snes, bsx, bsxslotted, sufamiturbo, sgb)

  – pal (PAL: snes, sgb)

  – world (World: dmg, gbc, gbc_gba)

• ROM images are loaded as: “rom <type> <file>”. The following 
  types are valid:

  – rom (Cartridge ROM in snes, dmg, gbc, gbc_gba. BIOS in bsx, 
    bsxslotted, sufamiturbo)

  – bsx (Cartridge ROM in bsx, bsxslotted)

  – slot-a (Cartridge ROM in sufamiturbo)

  – slot-b (Cartridge ROM in sufamiturbo)

• ROM markup can be loaded as: “xml <type> <file>”. The types 
  valid are the same as for ROMs.

• Patches can be loaded as “patch[<offset>] <type> <file>”. The 
  types are the same as for ROMs.

  – Offset is given in form [+-]<number>. Usually offset is 
    either +0 or -512.

  – Default offset is +0.

14.1 Example:

[GAMEPACK FILE]

type snes

rom rom speedygonzales.sfc

patch-512 rom sonicthehedgehog.ips

14.2 Example 2:

[GAMEPACK FILE]

type sgb

rom rom supergameboy.sfc

rom dmg megamanV.dmg

15 Quick'n'dirty encode guide

1. Start the emulator and load the ROM and movie file.

2. Set large AVI option 'set-setting avi-large on'

3. Enable dumping 'dump-avi tmpdump' 

4. Unpause and let it run until you want to end dumping.

5. Close the emulator (closing the window is the easiest way). Or 
  use 'end-avi'.

6. For each tmpdump*.avi file created, on command prompt, do 
  'x264 --crf 10 -o tmpdump_<numbers>.mkv tmpdump_<numbers>.avi'.

7. Do 'sox tmpdump.sox tmpdump.ogg rate -v 32000'

8. Do 'mkvmerge -o tmpdump_video.mkv tmpdump_0000000.mkv + 
  tmpdump_0000001.mkv + tmpdump_0000002.mkv' (list every 
  tmpdump_<numbers>.mkv, with + in between).

9. Do 'mkvmerge -o final.mkv tmpdump_video.mkv tmpdump.ogg'. Now 
  final.mkv contains quick'n'dirty encode.

16 Axis configurations for some gamepad types:

16.1 XBox360 controller:

Axes 2 and 5 (joystick<n>axis2 and joystick<n>axis5) should be 
set to pressure-+.

set-axis joystick0axis2 pressure-+

set-axis joystick0axis5 pressure-+

• This is needed for SDL only. EVDEV sets those types correctly.

16.2 PS3 “sixaxis” controller:

Axes 8-19 should be disabled.

set-axis joystick0axis8 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis9 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis10 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis11 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis12 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis13 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis14 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis15 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis16 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis17 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis18 disabled

set-axis joystick0axis19 disabled
